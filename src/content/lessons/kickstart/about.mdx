Project Kickstart 2020 is a programme aimed at teaching children basic programming skills in Scratch, a blocked based visual programming language that is fun and simple to use. 

Due to the current COVID-19 situation, the programme has been shortened to three online lessons held on Zoom, each being about an hour long. It was held from June to July 2020.

This year's edition of project Kickstart follows Cubert, the main character of the story, and his attempts to escape from The Maze. The children will have to use their programming skills to construct exits and teleporters as well as help Cubert to move around The Maze.
