Our Data Science programme helps children develop basic data literacy skills. In this programme, we introduce bar charts, pie charts, timelines and pictographs in a fun and engaging way! Students will get the chance to make their own charts with our custom apps, including a data visualisation tool made in Scratch.

Due to the current COVID-19 situation, the programme has been shortened to three online lessons held on Zoom, each being about an hour long. It was held from July to August 2020.

In this 3 week programme, students have the opportunity to chart their own daily habits. They will get to see how data from their daily lives can be represented in different ways, while getting a good sense of how much time they spend on each activity and how they can better utilise their limited time.
